# Numerical_Methods_Algorithms
This repository contains 3 different numerical method algorithms (written in MATLAB as functions) that I have created for a course (Mech 105 - Problem Solving) at Colorado State University as a part of my Mechanical Engineering undergraduate curriculum. 

## False Position Test Algorithm: MATLAB Function
The false position function (falsePosition.m) will estimate the root of a function using inputted information by the user. See the README.md in falsePositionFiles for more information.

## Lu Factor Algorithm: MATLAB Function
The lu factor function (luFactor) will determine the lu factorization of an inputted square matrix by the user. See the README.md in luFactorFiles for more information.

## Simpson Algorithm: MATLAB Function
The simpson function will integrate experimental data using Simpson's 1/3 rule. See the README.md in simpsonFiles for more information.
